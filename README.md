#  ECinemaTicket App
## (Project made for course purposes)

This is a project I made while studying an ASP.NET course at my university. Nothing special but it does have some features
that helped me better understand the importance of MVC patterns, payments, invoices and so on. It still has some tweaking left so that it would be a complete package.

## APP CAPABILITIES

- Invoice creation (Creating PDF's according to user orders)
- Importing users through uploaded Excel files
- Exporting data to an Excel file
- Default authentication
- Cart management (ECommerce behavior)
- Stripe testing payments

## CAPABILITIES IN NEED OF TWEAKING

- Email sender services
- Role creation and management
